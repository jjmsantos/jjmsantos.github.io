        <P>
            Hello World!<br>
            My name is Jeremy J.M. Santos.<br>
            I am a 27 year old guy looking to take on a job as a full-stack developer.
            I had minor experience with coding a while back when I taken Computer Engineering Technology at Humber College and I stopped 2 years before graduation, as the spark to become a computer engineer died.<br>
            I took on odd jobs here and there until I settled where I currently work today as a Produce Associate Team Leader for Whole Foods Market!<br>
            After 7 years in the retail/retail managment industry I am looking to make a 180 degree turn back into the tech industry!<br>
            I am taking a 6-month Web Developer Bootcamp with University Of Toronto to help me develop the skills needed to help me survive in the industry.
            This website is my portfolio along with projects that were associated with the bootcamp to help people like you, employers, gauge where my skill level is and how I can be an asset to your company!
        </P>
