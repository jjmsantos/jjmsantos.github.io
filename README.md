# Introduction
***

Hello, my name is Jeremy Santos
This is my coding portfolio with repos of my work that I have completed.

I am currently a Produce Associate Team Leader for Whole Foods Market.
I have been in the Retail/ Retail Management industry for roughly 7 years.
With the 7 years of experience in that industry, I have picked up and developed some key skills that are transferable.

Such as; 
* Being able to manage a medium sized team.
* Work & lead a team to success, instead of micro-managing a team.
* Keep in constant communication with other teams and leaders.
* Maintain a positive team morale

I have taken computer engineering technology in that past at Humber College, but dropped the program 2 years before graduation as the fire to become a Computer Engineer died.
Today, I look to make a 180 degree turn back into the tech industry by taking on a Coding Bootcamp at University of Toronto to help me develop the skills needed to survive and strive in the tech industry.
